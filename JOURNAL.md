## 10/27/2025 - creating CAD files through OpenSCAD  

hii guys...after finishing the readme and bom.csv, i got to working on the cad files which took me long enough as im doing it for the first time...
the screenshot that im attaching is not the final work its still in the process, im still learning on how to do it :)
i mean it went well..mostly chatgpt helped me but im learning too :)
there were some errors in the starting but i fixed it without any help of AI so ill take that as a plus point :)
