## 10/26/2025 - just finished BOM.csv  

hi guys! first time dealing with hardware and ngl its pretty exiciting :)

through the help of sources, i finished bom.csv with all of the verified links and estimated cost to the parts that i need to build this drone and hope i can get the grant :)

thanks!![Screenshot 2025-10-26 224229](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NTczMiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--0f30e194a5241f2d143fcbe82ccde1707737bc29/Screenshot%202025-10-26%20224229.png)
  

## 10/27/2025 4 PM - creating CAD files through OpenSCAD  

hii guys...after finishing the readme and bom.csv, i got to working on the cad files which took me long enough as im doing it for the first time...
the screenshot that im attaching is not the final work its still in the process, im still learning on how to do it :)
i mean it went well..mostly chatgpt helped me but im learning too :)
there were some errors in the starting but i fixed it without any help of AI so ill take that as a plus point :)
that's it :)

## 10/27/2025 8 PM - improved the CAD   

update! improved the CAD with more realistic components, next is to add the electrical components and all the asethetic from the bom.csv

overall, this was a pretty good run from last time as im getting used to it, and liked playing around with all the parts to make it more better.

adding a screenshot to show my CAD :)

## 10/28/2025 11 AM - made the CAD more better to reality  

hi guys!...after yesterday, i tried to mimic every single component in the OPENSCAD and it kinda worked but after many errors..
it was overall good for learning but i can still improve it more better to match it with reality :)
thats it for today :)

## 10/28/2025 10 PM - tryna improve SCAD  

spent a few hours working on how to improve the CAD even more since thats the only one 3D design i could submit for a grant. it is tough, worse than before as the errors took a long time to solve along with building the components;

i know the screenshot would loo like i hv done nothing..but dw im learning :)
