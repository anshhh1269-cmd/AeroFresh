# AeroFresh - The Flying Air Freshener Drone
hi guys!...so this is me trying to create a hardware project for the first time to add in my applications for my unis. I'm trying to create a drone that lifts slightly above the ground to disperse scent in a room or environment, combining LEDs, motion sensing, and an aroma diffuser into one unit. 

Basically it uses propellers to fly and a DC fan to disperse the scent around the room with the help of a heating resistor to vaporize the scent oil.

## Why I made this project

My first goal for my first hardware project was to create something useful, as well as something that can move around, is fun to play with, and connects with its environment to enhance it with a pleasant scent. 



## How It Works

1. The **ESP32** controls motor speed (PWM), LED lighting (WS2812B), and heater timing.
2. The **motors** generate airflow to spread aroma.
3. The **heating resistor** gently warms the cotton oil pad to vaporize scent.
4. The **LED ring** changes color depending on the selected mode or temperature.
5. The device runs on battery or USB input.
