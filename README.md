# AeroFresh - The Flying Air Freshener Drone
AeroFresh is a compact, desk-sized air freshener drone that lifts slightly or spins to disperse scent evenly in a room. It combines LEDs, motion sensing, and an aroma diffuser into one compact unit. Designed for makers who want a project that not only smells good, looks good, but also works smart. 
It uses **mini propellers** to circulate the fragrance around the room and its environment, and a **heating resistor** to vaporize the oil from the small cotton reservoir 
## Why I made this project
My goal was to make something useful but also something that feels fun and outgoing with its eenvironment. Itâ€™s a project about making everyday objects more interactive using accessible components and open-source tools.

## ðŸ§  How It Works

1. The **ESP32** controls motor speed (PWM), LED lighting (WS2812B), and heater timing.
2. The **motors** generate airflow to spread aroma.
3. The **heating resistor** gently warms the cotton oil pad to vaporize scent.
4. The **LED ring** changes color depending on the selected mode or temperature.
5. The device runs on battery or USB input.
